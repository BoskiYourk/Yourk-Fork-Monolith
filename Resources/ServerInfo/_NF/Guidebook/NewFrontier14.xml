  # The Monolith Beckons

Like many others before and after you, you've come to this sector for many things. Be it glory, be it The Monolith, be it war, be it money. You're here for a reason, it's time to get started.

[color=#33bbff]If you'd like a hand, ask on the radio, or talk to somebody.[/color]
The [color=#dd0000]Station Traffic Control[/color] or [color=#009933]Colonial Liaison[/color] should be able to help, they're commonly found on the CO.

  Any money that you make is [bold]yours[/bold], and will be available in future shifts if deposited at a [color=#44cc00]Galactic Bank ATM[/color] on Colonial Outpost or Tinnia's Rest.

To make money, why not:
- Join a ship's crew? Ask on the radio if anyone needs extra crew, and work to help your captain.
- Get a job on station? Ask the [color=#009933]Colonial Liaison[/color] (follow the SR signs) if anything needs doing.
- Use a [color=#cccc00]shipyard console[/color] to purchase your own ship.

  Some provisions (e.g. air tanks, salvage equipment) are available from vendors on Colonial Outpost, but most amenities (medical services, food) should be offered by players on shuttles or at the Trade Depot.

Be sure to stock up at the Trade Depot if going out on an extended voyage, and take advantage of the [color=#33bbff]medical insurance tracker[/color] in your loadout, or from the NanoMed vendor in medbay.

Shifts on the Colossus Sector typically last for [color=#33bbff]eight hours[/color].
If you need to end your shift early or take a break, use the [color=#33bbff]cryo sleep chambers[/color] in the medbay on Colonial Outpost.
